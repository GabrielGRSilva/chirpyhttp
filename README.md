# Chirpy - Oh, I miss the old blue bird!
</div>

## What is this?

This is the code for a HTTP server based on a fictional social service called "Chirpy" (yes, you know why). This was built using the tools described below during the Boot.Dev course Learn HTTP Servers in TypeScript.

## Tools Used:

* TypeScript / JavaScript;
* PostgreSQL (database);
* NodeJS;
* Express;
* Nodemon (during development to make server restart easier).

This README.md is still being updated while the development of this project lasts.
